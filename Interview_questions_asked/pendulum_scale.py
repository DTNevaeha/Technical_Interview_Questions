# You have 12 balls how do you find the heaviest using a pendulum scale?

# A pendulum scale is a type of balance scale that consists of a horizontal beam supported by a central pivot. The beam has
# two pans or trays suspended from it, one on each side, where objects can be placed for weighing. The scale operates on
# the principle of torque, where the weight of an object on one side of the beam creates a torque that is balanced by an
# equal torque on the other side.

# To find the heaviest ball using a pendulum scale, you can follow these steps:

# 12 balls -> 3 groups of 4 balls each
# Weigh 2 groups against each other
# If one group is heavier, the heaviest ball is in that group
# If the groups weigh the same, the heaviest ball is in the third group
# Divide the group with the heaviest ball into 3 groups of 1 ball each and 1 group of 1 ball
# Weigh 2 groups against each other
# If one group is heavier, that ball is the heaviest
# If they weigh the same, the heaviest ball is the one that was not weighed
# If the heaviest ball is not found, repeat the process with the remaining group of 4 balls
